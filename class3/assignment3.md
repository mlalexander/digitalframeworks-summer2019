# Assignment 3: Cleaning data

First, read the [Quartz Guide to Bad Data](https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide)

1. Find a "large" dataset (6+ columns, 100+ rows) that would require cleaning before you can analyze it. This can be related to your final story idea, but it doesn't have to be.
2. Save an original copy of the data as a `.csv` file
3. Use the techniques you learned in class (and the power of Google) to clean the data, while documenting _each_ action you take. 
4. Save the cleaned data as a second `.csv` file.

In your GitHub repo, create a new file called `assignment3/README.md`. This will create a new _folder_ titled "assignment3" and within it you'll find your markdown file titled `README.md`. Your documentation/process/notes should go in the README.md file and be written using markdown. In the same `assignment3 ` folder, upload both the original data and your cleaned version.
