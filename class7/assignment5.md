# Assignment 5

"Interview" a dataset with three specific, interesting questions that you can find answers to. This can be related to your final project, but doesn't have to be. If you need a good starting point, I recommend [CDC data](https://www.cdc.gov/datastatistics/index.html).

1. Submit a link to the dataset you found, your three questions, as well as the answers to those questions.
2. Keep a data diary: write down all steps used to clean and analyze the data, including any Excel formulas. Excel formulas should be submitted using markdown language (between `grave accent marks`, also known as `a backtick`, commonly used to indicate code vs. text).
3. Write a sample headline and nut graf based on the most interesting answer among your three questions.
4. A drawing, mockup or sketch of at least one potential visualization. This can be electronic or on paper.
