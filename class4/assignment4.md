# Assignment 4: Story Pitch

Develop and write out your final story pitch. As part of your pitch, please include the following:

1. What data source(s) you plan on using (though you can always add more later)
2. Some sources you can talk to about the data or to get anecdotes from it
3. What elements in the data might be good candidates to visualize
4. What your news hook is - why is this timely? Why does this matter now?
5. What question will you answer with your data, and _why_ is it newsworthy?

Pitches are due by 6 p.m. on July 31, 2019.

### Example 

I plan to analyze the amount of time it takes for Supreme Court justices to be confirmed by the United States Senate. My question is: if the party in control of the Senate is different the president's party, does it take longer for justices to be confirmed? I'm also interested in times nominations appeared to be contentious even when the Senate aligned with the president's party.

To do this, I will use data on confirmation and nomination dates from the U.S. Supreme Court, as well as historical party data from the Senate and United States Presidency Project.

I could visualize the length of nomination fights. I could also visualize the number of justices each president nominated and how many were confirmed.

This is timely because of the upcoming fight over Brett Kavanaugh, who President Donald Trump recently nominated to the court.

For sources, I could talk to former Senate or White House aides who have worked on Supreme Court nominations. I could also talk to experts, potentially at universities, who study the relationship between the different branches of government.
