# Final project details

You must complete a final project for this class. The project has two components:
1. A 1,000-word story based substantially on a dataset with two proposals for data visualization, due by 6 p.m. on Tuesday, June 11.
1. In the second-to-last class (August 21), a fellow student will interview you about the piece.

The 1,000-word piece should answer an interesting question using data. The data component of the story must be substantial, and you need to dig into the dataset. If you just read toplines off a website without actually finding and downloading or creating a dataset, that is insufficient.

Additionally, you will mockup two data visualizations to include with your story. These can be done paper-on-pen, using data viz software such as Tableau or using design software like Adobe Illustrator. You are not required to visualize your entire dataset, but rather propose what an appropriate data visualization _would_ look like for the data you're reporting on.

For the interview component, I’m looking for something like what CNN or NPR regularly does when they bring the author of an interesting story in to give some details. The interviewer must be prepared with 3 or 4 questions, and the interviewee needs to be prepared to go into detail about the story and the reporting behind it. The interviewee should, as much as possible, use non-technical language as if they were communicating to a mass audience about how they broke the story.

The final project is all together worth 30% of your grade. It will break down as follows:

* 15% for written story
* 5% for data visualizations
* 3% for your role as interviewer (on someone else’s topic)
* 7% for your role as interviewee
